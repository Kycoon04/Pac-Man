# Pac-Man

This project was made in Java with Maven. It is a simulation of the "Pac-Man" game, created to provide a visual context for practicing and implementing algorithms to find the shortest path between two points,
such as "Dijkstra", "Floyd", and "BFS". The project was developed for the "Data Structures" course, focusing on the implementation of these algorithms.
